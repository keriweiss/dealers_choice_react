Note: This app is meant to allow you to mix color without wasting paint.
DISCLAIMER: The color mixer is not accurate! The colors are layered, rather than mixed, and therefore the percentages reflected in the 'Palette Info' are meaningless. As it stands today, this app is an idea, for pure joy, and should not be used as a tool.
